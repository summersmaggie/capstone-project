# Action Plan Post-Epicodus

The following plan reflects my goals for the period following my graduation from Epicodus. This list is broken down into high, medium and low priority. Most of the items of the high priority list are items that have been on my to-do list, and that I'd like to get done in the next few weeks. These are tasks that communicate to the world who I am, why I made this pivot, and what I'm passionate about. Most of the medium and low priority items are in-the-future items that I'd like to accomplish like learning a new language and participating in more meet-ups. 

## Action Items:

HIGH PRIORITY

* Set up custom domain on deployed portfolio project, implement Share buttons on the blog, put final touches on it, and promote it via LinkedIn, Twitter
  * Top priority because: I want to put the final touches on my website, and make sure it's hosted on my custom domain that I already have posession of. Also, once I've completed that task, I can cancel my Squarespace account and start promoting my new website that I created from scratch!
  * Priority rating: 1

* Write blog post about experience at Epicodus, and initial thoughts on pivoting career
  * Top priority because: I want this post to be timely, and since I am freshly done with Epicodus, it will have the most impact if I publish it ASAP. Plus, before deciding on coming to Epicodus I did a lot of research and read a lot of posts from past students, so I want to contribute my own thoughts on the topic in order to help other people.
  * Priority rating: 1

* Learn PHP and Magento during upcoming internship; do CodeAcademy PHP course while in internship to accelerate learning
  * Top priority because: I'm excited to learn a new language right after completing Epicodus, especially because it will increase my skill set immediately. To ensure I get the most out of the experience, I want to commit to learning more PHP on my own time, so I can be successful at my job and in future jobs.
  * Priority rating: 1

* Update LinkedIn and resume, including coming up with a succinct summary of who I am, what I offer and why it made sense for me to pivot from social media to programming
  * Top priority because: Because this is such a big life pivot for me, I want to make sure my reasoning and my career trajectory is communicated clearly via my LinkedIn and resume. This seems like a great opportunity to explain who I am and what motivates me, so I want to harness that and show it to the world.
  * Priority rating: 1
