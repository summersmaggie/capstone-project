# Capstone Project: The Wooden Tent Scheduler

This minimalistic scheduler tool will allow my family to schedule visits to our cabin in Mt. Hood National Forest, so we can minimize the back and forth of scheduling via texts and calls and so there is one place to go to see the upcoming schedule. Despite the myraid of tools already available, we haven't been able to find one that sticks for everyone.
